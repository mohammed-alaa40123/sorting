# Sorting Algorithms Visualisation in Python
This project is part of our CSE 221 course at Egypt University of Informatics (EUI)
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Python. These algorithms are commonly used in computer science and are essential for understanding fundamental sorting concepts.

## Algorithms Included

The repository currently includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Comb Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quicksort
- Selection Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file in this repository.



## Demo App
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://sortingeui.streamlit.app/)



## Getting Started

To use the sorting algorithms in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ````
   git clone https://github.com/mohammed-alaa40123/sorting.git
   ````

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ````
   cd sorting
   ````


3. Install the required Python packages by running:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Run the app using the following command:

``` bash
streamlit run app.py
````
4. Call the sorting function provided by the chosen algorithm, passing the array or list that you want to sort as the input.

5. Run your Python program and observe the sorted output.
